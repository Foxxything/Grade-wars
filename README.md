This menu is where a teacher would enter the number of students in each grade that, for example, participated in a spirit week. Once submitted, the admin can either `approve` or `deny`. You can see that <b>[here](https://github.com/Foxxything/Grade-wars#approval-panel)</b>.

# Admin
## Event Picker

Here is where you can first pick what event you're going to have, whether it is the `Food Hampers`, a `Student Count` event, or `No Event`. When the admin toggles the switches, it will change the preview once you select what you want. The user will then press `Start`, which starts this event globally (all teacher accounts will see this).

## Manual Point Change

In this panel, the admin can manually change the point values for any grade.

## Approval Panel

Here the user can approve or deny the teachers' points. When approved, they get added to the total counted points.
